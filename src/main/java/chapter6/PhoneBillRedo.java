and number of minutes used. One should be able to calculate the overage,
tax, and total on a phone bill, and also be able to print the itemized
bill. The following constructors should be present: default, id-only,
all fields. No matter what constructor is used, all fields should be set.
Create a class that instantiates the phone bill and prints the
itemized bill. */
